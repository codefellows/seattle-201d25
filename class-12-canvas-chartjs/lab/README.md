# Lab for Class 12 (Week 3, Tuesday)
### New Bus Mall Technical Goal

- Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a **bar chart** *instead of a list*.

- The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images.

**Stretch Goals**

- Stretch Goal (not required; only if you want an additional challenge): If you want to try some chart type other than a bar chart, do so.

- Stretch Goal (not required; only if you want an additional challenge): Apply some data organization prior to charting. Maybe you chart only the top 5 or top 10 items? Maybe you sort the click-through percentage and then only show the top 5, in order? Use your creativity. Think about how you would like this information to be presented if you were on a marketing analysis team and trying to make decisions about products to manufacture and market, come up with a plan for it, and build it! The best developers have the ability to see the needs of clients before clients do.

- Stretch goal: A student in a prior section of this course was showing this project to his wife, and she asked him, "What if don't want to vote for any of these? I don't like any of them!" Consider adding functionality whereupon a user can skip voting on a group of products, maybe limiting the "Skip" button to three uses or the like. Do what you think is reasonable.

- Stretch goal: To more finely determine the most popular products by pitting the vote-getters head-to-head, consider adding functionality that allows a user to choose among their top choices as presented head-to-head. Maybe this is a link out to a  different page or a second round of voting? It's up to you.

Submit your assignment on Canvas as usual.
