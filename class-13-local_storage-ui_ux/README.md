# Class 13: Add Local Storage to Your Vote Tracker; UI/UX Concepts

<a id="top"></a>
## Today's Plan: Week 3, Wednesday Lecture

### Announcements
- On Friday afternoon we'll publish the entrance exam for Code 301, which doubles as the final exam for this course, and it will be due by Sunday night by 11:59pm. Do take this exam even if you are not planning to go to Code 301 right away, as it is part of your grade for this course. The exam is a bit different from the quizzes for multiple reasons:

	1. It is longer: 25 questions. (Still all multiple-guess, at least)
	2. It is administered by a service called EdRepublic and is actually their exam mechanism embedded in Canvas, so it is going to look and feel a little different. You've seen it before, on the 201 entrance exam that you took.
	3. You only get one attempt at taking it. No re-dos.
	- Do note, though, that you can still be resourceful and use books, Google, a REPL, whatever, to answer the questions.

**Learning Objectives**

As a result of completing Day 13 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to understand concepts in persistence and the JavaScript commands needed to read/write to/from local storage, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate knowledge and command of JSON syntax and structure, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and also by a quiz administered in Canvas.

## UI & UX discussion

Let's have a discussion on UI/UX, and also look at a few websites (some awesome, some kind of randomly chosen) relating to design and interaction.

- [All Websites Look the Same](http://www.zeldman.com/2015/09/10/all-websites-look-the-same/)
- [5 Ridiculously Common Misconceptions about UX](https://www.sitepoint.com/5-ridiculously-common-misconceptions-about-ux/)
- [The A11Y Project](http://a11yproject.com/)
- [10 Web design trends you can expect to see on websites in 2015](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/01/02/10-web-design-trends-can-expect-see-2015/)
- [40 Stunning Website Designs with Great Color Schemes](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/10/25/40-stunning-website-designs-with-great-color-schemes/)
- [Practical Typography](http://practicaltypography.com/)
- [Seattle Times project on the Ehlwa River](https://github.com/seattletimes/elwha)

When you start with your own projects, one of the things you will be fully responsible for is UI and UX. Be thoughtful. Find a design or layout you like and build something that mimics it. ALWAYS try to view your project from the perspective of someone who has never seen it before. Does the user need instructions? Are the user interactions clear to a new user?

## Discussion on Final Projects

- Review project assignment specifications
- Discuss process for selecting projects and setting teams
- FAQ
  - Are all of the requirements firm? (No, there is room for negotiation, but variances must be pre-approved)
  - Can teams use API data? (Generally no, there are ways to mock that up more in line with our  technical command at this point. That's covered extensively in 301)
  - What can teams use outside of the good ole HTML, CSS, JS, etc.? Are there any approved libraries? (It's easier to name the excluded libraries: jQuery, any CSS libraries/frameworks such as Bootstrap or Skeleton. It's OK to use other libraries or utilities like ChartJS or Google Maps, but we'll discuss them as part of reviewing your project plan.)
