Nick & Ted's Excellent Workflow

1. Nick works on a branch called 'new-work'
2. Ted works on a branch called 'ted-time'
3. Nick finishes his work and pushes his branch to github
4. Nick rings the "merge party" bell so Ted knows to stop working and start the merge party
5. Ted checks out master on his computer, so does Nick.
6. Nick opens a pull request from 'new-work' -> 'master'
7. Ted reviews the pull request to make sure that the changes are good changes (i.e. not broken)
8. If the pull request is good, Ted merges the branch into master. (If not, he says "you gotta fix this stuff")
9. Nick and Ted both do "git pull origin master" on their local machines
10. Ted merges "master" into his "ted-time" branch so that his branch has the updates from Nick's work.
  10 a. git checkout ted-time
  10 b. git merge master
11. They both continue working.
